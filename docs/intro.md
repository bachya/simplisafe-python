# Introduction

`simplisafe-python` (hereafter referred to as `simplipy`) is a Python3,
`asyncio`-driven interface to the unofficial SimpliSafe™ API. With it, users can
get data on their system (including available sensors), set the system state,
and more.

**NOTE:** SimpliSafe™ has no official API; therefore, this library may stop
working at any time without warning.

**SPECIAL THANKS:** Original inspiration was obtained from
[`easysafe-python`][easysafe-python]; thanks to Scott Newman for all the hard work!
